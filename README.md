# Jailbird

Did you ever found yourself stuck in jail and needed to send out some information to run your business, without the guardians noticing? Well than this library is the solution you have been looking for!

Obviously im joking, this thing is an experiment and I would have to lie if I told you I wasn't drunk when I had the idea.

**What the heck?***

This library allows you to write data basically on every pixel of a given picture without destroying it. You really won't notice much maybe some unsharp edges.

**The bad side** 

Of course re rendering the image will destroy all data also it make image compression impossible without again destroying the data.
